                    <p>I am Kunlek, and I'm currently a master's student pursuing a degree in Information Systems at the prestigious 
                        New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). My life revolves around 
                        a blend of academic pursuits and a diverse range of interests that keep me both grounded and exhilarated. <br>
                        Studying Information Systems has been an immensely rewarding journey for me. It's a field where the fusion 
                        of technology and business processes creates endless possibilities. I find joy in dissecting complex problems, 
                        analyzing data, and discovering innovative solutions. The constantly evolving nature of technology keeps me engaged and motivated 
                        to explore its frontiers further.</p>
                        <p>My hobbies includes playing soccer, traveling to new places for photo journaling and I love reading novels.</p>
